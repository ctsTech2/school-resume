			never done a project like this. The format made sense, and I typed it all out so I could
			start getting used to typing in this format. I also took the time to make some of it my own 
			and it helped a lot. I included my notes as proof I didn't
			just copy and paste. I'm a rookie at this stuff and I'm not into plagerism, but I'm also not
			above watching someone else to get better.-->

							<ul>
								<li>Started out as a cook at age 15. Moved to serving at 19.</li>
								<li>Wasn't long before I ended up bartending. It's always been a
									more natural communication avenue for me. Less formal
									and more real.</li>
								<li>It's made me very comfortable talking to large groups and handling 
									high volume and stressful situations while staying upbeat and
									friendly.</li>
								<li>Most important thing bartending's taught me is to communicate with 
									people where they're at. Favorite mantra is "Anybody can 
									communicate the way they wanna communicate. It takes a REAL 
									person of influence to talk to people how THEY wanna 
									communicate."</li>
								<li>My current position is at a VERY high volume location. It's taught
									me that it doesn't matter how good you think you are, you need 
									good teammates to get big things done.</li>
