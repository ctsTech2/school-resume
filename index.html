								<li>Started out at DigitalTutors.com wanting to learn how to use 
									photoshop. Bought a Wacom tablet that I've used very little.</li>

									109 lessons, 18 hours</li>
								<li>Did mostly photoshop and drawing lessons on these 2 sites. Started
									dabbling with the programming lessons but had issues learning to
									make the text editors apply to the lessons I was watching.</li>
								<li>A friend introduced me to Code Academy last December and I've been on
									there ever since. Started the Full Stack curriculum and I'm 60%

							<ul>
								<li>Started out as a cook at age 15. Moved to serving at 19</li>
								<li>Wasn't long before I ended up bartending. It's always been a
									more natural communication avenue for me. Less formal
									and more real.</li>
								<li>It's made me very comfortable talking to large groups and handling 
									high volume and stressful situations while staying upbeat and
									friendly.</li>
								<li>Most important thing it's taught me is to communicate with people 
									where they're at. Favorite mantra is "Anybody can communicate
									the way they wanna communicate. It takes a REAL person of
									influence to talk to people how THEY wanna communicate."
